# Selendra 2.0

This document is a living document. So it will grow and change as we develop Selendra Open Network. 

Selendra is a multichain interoperable nominated Proof-of-Stake network for developing and running Substrate-based and EVM compatible blockchain applicaiton. 

# Usecases
- Digital Identity & Signature
- Stablecoins and DeFi
- DEX
- DAOs
- Assets tokenization
- Wallets, custody, payment, remittency & crypto on/off pamp
- Decentralized Storage & Computing

# Features
- On-chain tokens exchange
- Stablecoins Nucleus for DeFi ready
- Built-in Smart Contract (EVM & Wasm)
- Multi-networks token utilities
- Bridge to EVM chains and Substrate-based networks
- Aim to achive 1000+ TPS on one chain
- Fees charged are to be burned, while inflation are set 0.5% - 2.5% per year to make sure SEL will never reach its max supply of 3,141,592,654 token in 100 years. 


# To-do
Once the Selendra's network usage increase, millions of accounts created, and reach above 10 millions daily transactions, we will; 

- Selendra Native Parachains, create shards to increase TPS to 50,000-100,000
- Parathread to Polkadot Network
- Appchain with Near Protocol
- IBC to Cosmos Network

# Token

Issued on three networks; 
| Key                     | SEL                         |
| ------------------------| ----------------------------|  
| Max supply              | 3,141,592,654               | 
| Mainnet	              | 425,233,741                 | 
| ERC-20                  | 87,035,376                  | 
| BEP-20                  | 15,357,667                  | 
| Total supply	          | 527,626,784                 | 

1 SEL = 1.000,000,000,000 ROCK
1 ROCK = 0.000,000,000,001 SEL 

## Allocation 
- BEP-20	                15,357,667
- ERC-20	                87,035,376
- Existing users	        19,113,163
- Bridge Liquidity	        180,000,000	
- Foundation Governance	    200,000,000
- Teams	                    31,415,927

## Inflation		
- max:	    10,763,227	2.50%
- average:	4,305,291	1.00%
- min:	    2,152,645	0.50%

## Max supply guaranteed

All fees charged on Selendra are burned. New SEL token to be generated via inflation. This way SEL token's max supply will never ever reach in this century, leaving enough time for the next generation of users, builders, and governance to decide what they want to do with the max supply.
